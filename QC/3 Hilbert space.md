A **Hilbert space** is a complete vector space equipped with an inner product. It provides the mathematical setting for quantum mechanics, where states, observables, and dynamics are all formulated. Let‚Äôs dive into its key properties and then see how quantum systems are defined within this framework.

## 1. What Is a Hilbert Space?

A **Hilbert space** is a vector space \( \mathcal{H} \) over the complex (or sometimes real) numbers that has an inner product, which allows us to measure angles and lengths. Importantly, it is **complete**‚Äîmeaning that every Cauchy sequence of vectors in the space converges to a vector within the space.

### Key Features

- **Vector Space Structure:**  
  It supports vector addition and scalar multiplication, allowing us to form linear combinations. In quantum mechanics, any linear combination of state vectors is also a valid state.

- **Inner Product:**  
  An inner product \(\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle\) is defined on the space, which has the following properties:
  - **Conjugate Symmetry:**  
    ```math
    \langle \psi, \phi \rangle = \overline{\langle \phi, \psi \rangle}
    ```
  - **Linearity (in one argument):**  
    ```math
    \langle a\psi + b\phi, \chi \rangle = a\,\langle \psi, \chi \rangle + b\,\langle \phi, \chi \rangle
    ```
    where \(a, b\) are scalars.
  - **Positive-Definiteness:**  
    ```math
    \langle \psi, \psi \rangle \geq 0 \quad \text{with} \quad \langle \psi, \psi \rangle = 0 \text{ if and only if } \psi = 0.
    ```

- **Norm and Metric:**  
  The inner product induces a norm:
  ```math
  \|\psi\| = \sqrt{\langle \psi, \psi \rangle},
  ```
  which in turn defines a metric and allows us to discuss the convergence of sequences of vectors.

- **Completeness:**  
  Completeness ensures that limits of Cauchy sequences of vectors stay within the space. This property is crucial for the rigorous treatment of infinite processes, such as taking limits of series or handling continuous spectra.

- **Orthonormal Basis:**  
  In Hilbert spaces, every vector can be expressed as a (possibly infinite) linear combination of an orthonormal basis. An orthonormal basis \(\{ |e_i\rangle \}\) satisfies:
  ```math
  \langle e_i | e_j \rangle = \delta_{ij},
  ```
  and every vector \(|\psi\rangle \in \mathcal{H}\) can be written as:
  ```math
  |\psi\rangle = \sum_i c_i |e_i\rangle,
  ```
  where \( c_i = \langle e_i|\psi \rangle \) and the sum converges in the norm of the space.

## 2. Quantum Systems in the Language of Hilbert Spaces

In quantum mechanics, the state of a physical system is represented by a vector (commonly called a **ket**) in a Hilbert space.

### Quantum States

- **Pure States:**  
  A pure state is a normalized vector \(|\psi\rangle\) in a Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}\) such that:
  ```math
  \langle \psi | \psi \rangle = 1.
  ```
  Since the global phase (an overall complex constant of unit modulus) is physically irrelevant, the physical state is represented by a *ray*‚Äîan equivalence class of vectors differing only by a phase factor.

- **Mixed States:**  
  While pure states are described by state vectors, mixed states (which represent statistical ensembles) are described by density operators acting on the Hilbert space.

### Observables and Operators

- **Observables:**  
  Physical quantities (like position, momentum, or spin) are represented by self-adjoint (Hermitian) operators on the Hilbert space. Their eigenvalues correspond to possible measurement outcomes, and the corresponding eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis (or a generalized basis if the spectrum is continuous).

- **Measurement and the Born Rule:**  
  When a measurement is made, the probability of obtaining a particular eigenvalue is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product between the state and the corresponding eigenstate. Specifically, if \(\{ |\phi_i\rangle \}\) are eigenstates of an observable \(A\), then for a state \(|\psi\rangle\):
  ```math
  P(\phi_i) = |\langle \phi_i | \psi \rangle|^2.
  ```
  
- **Time Evolution:**  
  The evolution of the state vector is governed by a unitary operator \( U(t) \) (typically generated by the Hamiltonian of the system via the Schr√∂dinger equation):
  ```math
  |\psi(t)\rangle = U(t) |\psi(0)\rangle.
  ```
  Unitary operators preserve the norm (and hence the probabilities) in Hilbert space.
